# Group Project 'CuisineControl'

**CuisineControl** is an app that scans food items in order to store their expiration dates.  In addition, CuisineControl can keep track of what foods one has and use that information to generate a random recipe for the person to use.  CuisineControl can also specify these recipes, for example limiting the recipes to "Mexican" recipes or by limiting which ingredients that the person has.

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total
